  <h1>Thesara Terms of Use</h1>
  <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> November 2025</p>

  <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
  <p>By accessing or using Thesara (the “Platform”), you agree to be bound by these Terms of Use (“Terms”). Thesara is a platform operated by an individual based in Croatia (referred to as “Thesara,” “we,” or “us”). These Terms form a legally binding agreement between you (the user) and Thesara. If you do not agree with any part of these Terms, you must not use the Platform.</p>
  <p>The Platform is intended for users of all ages. If you are under the age of majority in your jurisdiction, you should review these Terms with a parent or legal guardian. By using Thesara, you confirm that you have any necessary parental consent or are otherwise legally permitted to use the Platform. You also agree to abide by all applicable laws and regulations when using Thesara.</p>

  <h2>2. Description of the Service</h2>
  <p>Thesara is an online platform that enables users to create, publish, share, and explore small software applications (“mini-apps”), often developed with AI tools such as ChatGPT. Users can upload their application code (either by uploading a bundle or by pasting code) to the Platform. Thesara will host the code and make the mini-app available through a “Play” feature, which runs the app in a sandboxed iframe within the user’s web browser. This sandboxed environment allows others to safely run and interact with your mini-app directly on the Platform.</p>
  <p>The Platform supports both free and paid mini-apps. Creators can choose to offer their apps to other users at no charge or set a price for access (see Section 6 on Payments and Earnings). Thesara provides the infrastructure to list mini-apps, handle purchases (if any), and deliver the content to end users in a secure manner. All mini-apps run in an isolated environment on Thesara’s infrastructure — users do not need to install anything locally to use the apps.</p>
  <p><em>Beta Version:</em> Thesara is currently in an early development beta phase. This means the service is still evolving, and you may encounter changes, bugs, or incomplete features as we improve the Platform. Please see Section 8 (Beta Notice) for more details on the implications of using a beta service.</p>

  <h2>3. User Accounts and Eligibility</h2>
  <p>To access certain features of Thesara (such as publishing a mini-app or making a purchase), you may be required to create a user account. When creating an account, you agree to provide accurate, current, and complete information. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account credentials and for all activities that occur under your account. If you become aware of any unauthorized use of your account or any other breach of security, you must notify us immediately.</p>
  <p>By creating an account or using the Platform, you represent that you have the legal capacity to enter into this agreement.</p>
  <p><strong>Account Security:</strong> You should choose a strong, unique password and not share your login details with others. Thesara will never ask you for your password via email or unsolicited contact. You are responsible for any actions taken through your account, so please guard your credentials carefully.</p>
  <p>We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your account (as detailed in Section 11) if any information provided during registration is false, or if you violate these Terms. Users of all ages are welcome on Thesara, but if you are a minor, ensure that your use is supervised by a parent or guardian where appropriate. The content you upload or interact with on the Platform must be appropriate for a general audience (see User Conduct below for prohibited content rules).</p>

  <h2>4. User Conduct and Acceptable Use</h2>
  <p>When using Thesara, you agree to behave lawfully, respectfully, and in a manner that fosters a safe environment for all users. You MUST NOT use the Platform (including any mini-app you create or run) in a way that:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Violates any law or regulation:</strong> You may not use Thesara for any unlawful purpose or to further any illegal activity.</li>
    <li><strong>Is malicious or harmful:</strong> You must not upload or distribute malware or any other code intended to disrupt, damage, or gain unauthorized access to any system, data, or personal information.</li>
    <li><strong>Is abusive or offensive:</strong> You may not post or share content that is defamatory, harassing, threatening, bullying, or hateful toward any individual or group. Content that is obscene, pornographic, excessively violent, or otherwise inappropriate for a general audience is not allowed.</li>
    <li><strong>Is deceptive or fraudulent:</strong> You must not use the Platform to mislead others (e.g., impersonation, scams, deceptive applications).</li>
    <li><strong>Infringes on rights of others:</strong> Do not upload or share any content that you do not have the right to use, or that violates others’ intellectual property, privacy, or other rights.</li>
    <li><strong>Interferes with the Platform’s security or operations:</strong> Do not attempt to circumvent or disable any security features, gain unauthorized access, or engage in activities that burden or disrupt the Platform.</li>
    <li><strong>Involves spam or unauthorized advertising:</strong> No unsolicited or bulk communications, spam, pyramid schemes, or phishing.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Failure to adhere to the above rules may result in content removal, account suspension, or other actions as described in Section 11 (Termination).</p>

  <h2>5. User Content and Intellectual Property Rights</h2>
  <h3>5.1 Your Content and License to Thesara</h3>
  <p>When you create or upload content to Thesara, you retain ownership of all intellectual property rights in that content. Thesara does not claim ownership over the apps or content you create. However, by submitting or uploading content, you grant Thesara a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license to host, store, reproduce, modify (for technical purposes), distribute, publicly display, and perform your content for the purpose of operating, displaying, and promoting the Platform.</p>
  <p>You can remove or delete your content at any time. Upon removal, the license you granted will generally end after a reasonable period necessary to fully remove it from our systems. Residual copies may persist temporarily due to caching or backups. If your app was purchased by other users before you removed it, those users may retain the ability to access it.</p>
  <p>By uploading content, you represent and warrant that you have all necessary rights to that content and that our use of it in accordance with these Terms will not infringe or violate the rights of any third party.</p>

  <h3>5.2 Thesara’s Intellectual Property</h3>
  <p>Except for user-generated content, all other elements of the Platform are owned by Thesara or our licensors, including software code, design, logos, trademarks, service marks, graphics, and overall look-and-feel. You are not granted any rights to use Thesara’s name, logos, or any trademarks or copyrighted materials, except as necessary to use the service for its intended purpose.</p>

  <h3>5.3 Content Moderation and Responsibility</h3>
  <p>Thesara is a host for user content. We do not systematically pre-screen or review all content before it is published. We reserve the right to review, disable, or remove any user content at our discretion. You are solely responsible for the content you create, upload, and publish on Thesara, as well as any consequences of running or sharing that content.</p>

  <h2>6. Purchases, Payments, and Earnings</h2>
  <p>Some mini-apps on Thesara are free to use, while others may be offered for sale by their creators. The following terms apply to financial transactions on the Platform:</p>
  <h3>6.1 Payment Processing</h3>
  <p>All payments on Thesara are handled through a third-party payment processor (currently Stripe). You authorize Thesara (and Stripe, on our behalf) to charge your provided payment method for any purchases you make on the Platform. Prices for apps are set by the app’s creator (or by Thesara in certain cases) and will be clearly indicated at the time of purchase in U.S. Dollars (USD) or another disclosed currency. You are responsible for any fees or taxes that apply to your purchases.</p>
  <h3>6.2 Purchasing Apps</h3>
  <p>When you buy access to a paid mini-app, you are purchasing a limited, non-transferable license to access and use that app via the Thesara Platform. The purchase is binding once completed. All sales are considered final by default. If you encounter a serious issue with a purchased app, you may contact us for support or to request a refund (see Refund Policy).</p>
  <h3>6.3 Selling Apps (Creators’ Earnings)</h3>
  <p>Creators can earn revenue from users purchasing their apps. Thesara charges a commission of 30% on the gross revenue of all app sales. Creators receive 70% of the sale price (excluding any taxes or fees) as earnings for each sale.</p>
  <h3>6.4 Payouts to Creators</h3>
  <p>Earnings will accumulate in your Thesara account balance. You can request a payout once your balance exceeds $50 USD. Payouts are disbursed via supported methods (e.g., Stripe Connect, bank transfer). You are responsible for any third-party transfer fees and for reporting and paying applicable taxes.</p>
  <h3>6.5 Refund Policy</h3>
  <p>As a general rule, all purchases on Thesara are final and non-refundable. However, in exceptional cases (e.g., a technical issue where an app fails to load or is substantially not as described) we may, at our sole discretion, provide a refund or credit if the issue is verified and reported within a reasonable time (e.g., within 14 days of purchase).</p>
  <h3>6.6 Payment Disputes and Chargebacks</h3>
  <p>In the event of a chargeback or payment dispute, Thesara reserves the right to deduct the disputed amount (and any associated fees) from the relevant Creator’s earnings if the purchaser’s dispute is found valid.</p>
  <h3>6.7 Changes to Fees</h3>
  <p>Thesara may change its pricing structure, commission rate, or payment policies in the future, with advance notice to Creators where feasible.</p>

  <h2>7. Security and Platform Integrity</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Sandboxed Execution:</strong> All user-created mini-apps run in a sandboxed iframe environment.</li>
    <li><strong>Content Security Policy (CSP):</strong> We enforce a strict CSP on all mini-apps, restricting resource sources.</li>
    <li><strong>No Sensitive Tokens in Iframes:</strong> Authentication tokens or sensitive user credentials are never stored inside the app iframe.</li>
    <li><strong>Controlled API Calls (Proxy Layer):</strong> Network requests made by a mini-app are generally routed through Thesara’s parent page or proxy.</li>
    <li><strong>Storage and Data Access:</strong> Mini-apps do not have direct access to persistent browser storage in the usual way; a safe storage API is provided.</li>
    <li><strong>Security Monitoring:</strong> We monitor the Platform for unusual activity or potential security breaches.</li>
    <li><strong>User Responsibilities:</strong> Do not attempt to hack, modify, or find exploits in the Platform or others’ mini-apps. Report vulnerabilities responsibly.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>While we implement robust security measures, no system is 100% foolproof. Use your best judgment.</p>

We do not guarantee uptime or performance, the accuracy or usefulness of content, or that mini-apps are free of vulnerabilities. To the fullest extent permitted by law, Thesara disclaims all warranties, express or implied, including implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement.</p>

  <h2>10. Limitation of Liability</h2>

  <h2>11. Termination and Suspension</h2>
  <p>We may suspend, disable, or terminate your access to the Platform at any time for legitimate reasons, including violations of these Terms or applicable law. You may stop using Thesara at any time and request account deletion. Certain provisions survive termination (e.g., IP rights, disclaimers, limitations of liability, indemnification, governing law).</p>
  <p><strong>Indemnification:</strong> To the extent permitted by law, you agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Thesara and its operator/owner from claims arising out of your use of the Platform, your violation of these Terms, your content, or your negligence/willful misconduct.</p>

  <h2>12. Changes to these Terms</h2>
  <p>Thesara may modify or update these Terms from time to time. We will update the “Last Updated” date and, if changes are significant, provide a prominent notice. Continued use of the Platform after revised Terms are posted constitutes acceptance.</p>

  <h2>13. Governing Law and Dispute Resolution</h2>
  <p>These Terms are governed by the laws of the Republic of Croatia, without regard to conflict of law principles. Unless otherwise required by law, the competent court in the city of Zagreb, Croatia shall have exclusive jurisdiction. EU consumer protections may also apply to EU residents.</p>
