We limit processing to the data that is necessary to create or manage your account, publish and play browser apps, provide support, and meet legal obligations.",
      "data.title": "Information we collect",
      "data.body": "When you sign up we store your email, display name, profile photo (if provided) and basic usage telemetry so we can secure your account and keep the service reliable. Publishing or editing apps requires us to process the content you upload (titles, descriptions, assets, bundles, preview images) as well as metadata such as room codes or leaderboard states you create. If you purchase paid plans or add-ons we keep subscription identifiers, invoice references and tax-relevant details; payment card data is handled directly by our payment provider.",
      "processors.title": "Processors & integrations",
      "processors.body": "To run Thesara we rely on a short list of trusted partners: Firebase and Cloudflare store authentication records, databases, media and backups; Stripe processes payments and sends us non-sensitive billing metadata; Redis/BullMQ powers build queues; our translation feature can call an LLM provider to generate optional localisations; transactional email is delivered via an SMTP relay; advertising inventory is served through Google AdSense if you consent to it. These partners only receive the data required for their function and they all commit to appropriate contractual safeguards.",
      "adsense.title": "Google AdSense & cookies",
      "adsense.body": "Display ads are offered only to visitors who have not purchased our No Ads plan or similar entitlements. Before we load any Google script we ask you to choose whether personalised ads are allowed. If you decline, AdSense runs in non-personalised mode (npa=1) and shows contextual placements based on the page content. Users who buy No Ads or access apps through the Play sandbox do not load the AdSense script at all.",
      "retention.title": "Storage & retention",
      "retention.body": "Account data remains stored while you maintain a Thesara profile. App bundles, previews and storage namespaces stay online until you delete the related listing, clear the data yourself, or request removal through support. Billing records are retained only for the period required by tax and audit regulations, and system logs used for security are rotated on a regular schedule.",
      "choices.title": "Your controls",
      "choices.body": "You can update or delete listings, assets, rooms and storage data you control, adjust consent preferences through the banner, disable ads by purchasing No Ads, and manage account information from settings.
